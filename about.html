  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    Hi! I'm Daniel, a student interested in 3D design, programming,
    and game development. I enjoy working on creative projects
    using code and design tools. I'm currently a Design Lead in our school's robotics FRC team 2658. If you couldn't tell, my two favorite colors are green and orange, a good mix!
